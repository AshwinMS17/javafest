    <h3>Serverless Enterprise Monoliths – The IaC and IfC way</h3>

<article class="col-lg-12"><p>An Amazon internal case study has caused some surprise and amusement in the developer community, thanks to its frank assessment of how to save money by moving from a microservices architecture to a monolith.</p>
<p>The Prime Video team found that moving their service to a monolith reduced their infrastructure cost by over 90%. They also increased their scaling capabilities.</p>
<p>The team attributed the cost savings to a number of factors, including the elimination of the need for load balancers and the ability to use a single billing plan.</p>
<p>The team also noted that the monolith was easier to manage and debug than the microservices architecture.
The case study has raised some eyebrows in the developer community, as it challenges the conventional wisdom that microservices are the best way to build scalable and resilient applications. In this context we recommend that Serverless Monoliths with Fully Automated Deployments through code as the solution, that eliminate all the manual works.</p>
<p>This talk is about&hellip;</p>
<p>Serverless Monolith is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure and dynamically allocates resources to applications based on demand. This can save businesses money on operational costs, as they no longer need to purchase and maintain their own servers.</p>
<p>Serverless Monolith is also scalable, as applications can be easily scaled up or down as needed. This is ideal for businesses that experience fluctuating traffic patterns.</p>
<p>In addition to cost savings and scalability, serverless computing can also improve developer productivity. Developers can focus on writing code, rather than managing infrastructure. This can lead to faster time to market and a higher quality of code.</p>
<p>IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and IfC (Infrastructure from Code) are methodologies that can be used to manage serverless infrastructure and configuration. IaC enables the creation and management of infrastructure resources using code, allowing for version control, automated testing, and reproducible deployments. IfC, on the other hand, enables the creation and management of infrastructure and configuration using code, providing more flexibility and control over the application&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>By combining serverless Monoliths with IaC and IfC, businesses can build cost-effective, scalable, and reliable messaging applications. Here are some of the benefits of using this approach:</p>
<p>Reduced operational costs: You no longer need to purchase and maintain your own servers, which can save you a significant amount of money.
Increased scalability: Applications can be easily scaled up or down as needed, without any manual intervention.
Improved developer productivity: Developers can focus on writing code, rather than managing infrastructure. This can lead to faster time to market and a higher quality of code.
Greater flexibility and control: IaC and IfC give you more control over your infrastructure and configuration. This can help you to optimize your costs, improve your security, and meet your compliance requirements.
If you are looking for a cost-effective, scalable, and reliable way to build messaging applications, then I encourage you to consider using serverless computing with IaC and IfC.
Here are some of the challenges of using serverless messaging with IaC and IfC:
Complexity: Serverless computing can be complex, especially when it comes to managing infrastructure and configuration.
Vendor lock-in: Some cloud providers offer proprietary serverless solutions that can lock you into their platform.
Performance: Serverless applications can be less performant than traditional applications, especially if they are not designed and architected properly.
Here are some tips for overcoming the challenges of using serverless messaging with IaC and IfC:
Choose the right cloud provider: Not all cloud providers offer the same serverless features and capabilities. Do your research and choose a provider that meets your needs.
Use open source tools: There are a number of open source tools that can help you to manage serverless infrastructure and configuration. These tools can help you to reduce costs, improve security, and meet your compliance requirements.
Design and architect your applications properly: Serverless applications can be less performant than traditional applications. It is important to design and architect your applications properly to ensure that they meet your performance requirements.
Some of the things that attendees can learn from your talk:
What is serverless computing and how does it work?
The benefits of using serverless computing for messaging applications
How to use IaC and IfC to manage serverless infrastructure and configuration
How to overcome the challenges of using serverless computing
Best practices for building scalable, reliable, and secure serverless monolith applications.
In addition to these specific topics, attendees will also learn about the latest trends in serverless computing and how they can be applied to their own messaging applications. They can also ask questions and get feedback from the speaker.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>
