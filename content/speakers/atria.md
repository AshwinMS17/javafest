I am an experienced technical leader in the space of distributed databases and have worked on multiple database engines. I have been a major contributor to PostgreSQL, where I implemented major features like JDBC Foreign Data Wrapper, Ordered Set Aggregates, ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING and GROUPING SETS. I have implemented major features in Greenplum, such as large objects support, complex numbers datatype, resource management and miscellaneous improvements in query optimiser.

I have been a part of CosmosDB, where I worked on scaling CosmosDB to be a true HTAP engine. I lead the Columnar engine effort, was working on improving indexing efforts within the product, and was generally responsible for setting the technical direction and leading the group to make CosmosDB a fully functional analytical database engine

I am an open source exponent and am PMC Member and Committer for various open source database engines, such as Apache Apex, Apache HAWQ and Apache MADLib. I also help new projects to incubate in Apache Software Foundation.

I am currently focused on Presto, where I am working on scaling Presto to be a fully functional OLAP engine. I have recently released functionality to scale Window Aggregates infinitely, allow sort nodes to scale infinitely, improve subquery planning, improve semijoin execution performance, implement FILTER clauses for aggregates, improve optimizer's capabilities to push down disjunctive predicates. I collaborate with the Presto community on multiple features and am currently helping on improvements for the cost based optimiser.

I have filed 20 odd patents in the space of distributed databases and query optimization.

I am an active speaker across multiple data conferences, having spoken at ApacheCon Big Data, PostgreSQL Conf, Open Source Summit multiple times.
