"If you've to live for 1000 more years, then what is that one thing that you'll keep doing?"

For me the Answer was "Teaching".

So here I'm teaching Students, Experienced Professionals through my experience.

Every week I write about - Programming Tips, Tricks, Java, and Back-end Development in General.

Which can help you get started with your Programming Journey as a noob.

On the Professional Front:
- I am Sr. Backend Engineer(Freelancer), holds expertise in Java, Spring, Hibernate, and JPA Frameworks.
- Worked on Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, AWS, and DevOps tools.
- Check out my Projects & Experience section to know more about my work.
