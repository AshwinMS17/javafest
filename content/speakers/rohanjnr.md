Hello there, I’m Rohan Reddy Alleti, a self-taught programmer and Solution Consultant at Sahaj Software, with expertise in backend development, cloud computing, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. With a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from PES University, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation through both formal education and independent learning.

At Sahaj, I focus on designing and implementing RAG pipelines. I’m passionate about collaboration and enjoy working closely with teams to communicate ideas and deliver effective solutions. I’ve also contributed to open-source projects and led web development efforts using technologies like Django, FastAPI.
