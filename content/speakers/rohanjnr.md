Hello there! My name is Rohan, a self-taught programmer, and a university student.

Though I might not have any professional experience in programming, I have contributed to many open-source projects which have considerably increased my programming skill.
Currently working on Web Development, with the Django web framework.
Also learning JavaScript and Kotlin.
