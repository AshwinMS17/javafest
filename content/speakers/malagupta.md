I'm passionate about making people employable by bridging the gap between their existing and required skills. In my quest to fulfill this mission, I've authored books to help IT professionals and students succeed on industry-recognized Oracle Java Certifications.

I have Master's degree in Computer Applications along with various other certifications from Oracle. I have over 18 years of experience in IT as a developer, architect, trainer and mentor.

I have worked with international training and software services organisations on various Java projects. I am experienced in mentoring teams on technical and software development processes. I am the founder and lead mentor at eJavaGuru.com. 

I am a firm believer in creativity as an essential life skill. To popularize the importance of creativity, innovation and design in life, I have also co-founded KaagZevar.com - a platform for nurturing these values.
