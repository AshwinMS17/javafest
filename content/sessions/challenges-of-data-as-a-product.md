In the ever-evolving landscape of software products, the focus has transitioned from solely applications (web or mobile) to the realization that they are merely interfaces. The emergence of the "API as a Product" trend brought this paradigm shift to the forefront. However, in the era of artificial intelligence, data has emerged as the reigning monarch. The concept of "Data as a Product" has gained momentum, but it presents unique challenges that require careful consideration.

This thought-provoking session aims to explore the intricate landscape of treating data as a product. Unlike previous trends, dealing with data as a product demands a strong emphasis on data governance to safeguard its sensitivity, prevent misuse, and maintain accuracy. The concept of Data Mesh enters the picture as a comprehensive solution, but its implementation involves multiple dimensions and considerations.

During this talk, we will dive into the challenges that lie ahead on the path to embracing the next generation of the Data as a Product movement. We will discuss the complexities of data governance, highlighting the need for robust policies and frameworks to ensure data integrity, privacy, and security. Additionally, we will explore the broader aspects of Data Mesh, delving into its implications, benefits, and potential pitfalls.

Join us in this engaging session, where we will collectively unravel the intricacies of this evolving landscape. By understanding the challenges and potential roadblocks, attendees will be better equipped to navigate the path toward a successful Data as a Product journey, unlocking the true potential of data in their organizations.
