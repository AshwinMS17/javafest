In the realm of data-driven technologies, the role of a Data Engineer often finds itself overshadowed by its counterpart, Data Science. However, it is crucial to recognize that Data Engineering constitutes a distinct field that demands its own unique skill set. This talk aims to dispel the misconception that mere familiarity with popular tools such as Spark, Hadoop, or Kafka is sufficient to excel as a Data Engineer.

In this session, we will delve into the essential building blocks that form the foundation of Data Engineering. While high-level tools garner significant attention, the fundamental aspects tend to be overlooked. We will explore critical areas such as storage formats, data exchange formats, and the diverse categories of tools, including Data Lake, Data Mesh, and Data Warehouse.

Through practical examples and real-world insights, this presentation will guide the audience on the journey of becoming a true Data Engineer. By focusing on the core knowledge and expertise required, attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the indispensable concepts necessary to embark on successful data engineering endeavors.
