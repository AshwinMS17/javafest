JavaFest is an non-profit, non-promotional, community driven annual technology conference organized by multiple Java User Groups(JUG) across India, including Bangalore, Mumbai, Madras, Delhi, and Hyderabad. JUG consists of engineers from top companies such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Redhat, Salesforce, Jetbrains, and more. As a Java User Group, we are committed to distributing Java-related knowledge. We conduct monthly meetups where experts share their experiences on the latest technology developments. Through JavaFest, we aim to bridge the gap between the professionals and students and create a platform for knowledge sharing and networking, leading to job opportunities.
