title: 'Architecture’s Birds of a Feather (BoF)'
---

**Architecture’s Birds of a Feather (BoF)** talks at conferences are informal gatherings where participants with shared interests discuss specific topics in an interactive and open format and connect with like-minded individuals in a relaxed setting. These talks encourage networking, knowledge exchange, and community building around subjects of mutual interest.

If there are any specific architectural challenges or need guidance on architectural decision-making, via the "Architecture Clinic" booth, leaders can share their insights or guide the developer community.
